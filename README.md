SQL Mini-Project

The main goal of this project was to develop a deeper understanding of various MySQL date functions and features. 
The project utilizes two tables, **users** and **logins**, and consists of seven questions designed to explore and apply functions such as CURDATE(), DATE_SUB(), DATE_FORMAT(), QUARTER(), EXTRACT(), and window functions including LEAD(), LAG(), and ROW_NUMBER(), as well as the implementation of recursive Common Table Expressions (CTEs).
